<h1>El Pollo loco</h1>

El pollo loco is a jump & run game inspired by Super Mario. Building this project was a lot of fun and if you enjoy it, feel free to add new levels and create a pull request. The game features the main character called Pepe that has to defeat crazy chickens by throwing salsa bottles at them. 

I did not use any gaming libraries for this project, everything is built with vanilla JS. I used a an animation frame that continously repaints a canvas.
